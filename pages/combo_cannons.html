        <h1>Combination Magnetic Cannons</h1>
        <p>
            Combo-cannons, as the name suggests, are magnetic cannons that use a combination of gauss, rail and coil propulsion systems. This ins't perfect, as the problems from each design carry over to the full cannon.

            While any of the three work on their own, they're much better toghether. Rail-coilguns are perfecct for plasma munitions, with very low friction on the rails and an extremely light projectile. Gauss-railguns are great for extreme power, often working best with solid slug type ammo. And Gauss-coilguns are great for payloads or things that shouldn't heat up before impact.
