            Coilguns are more complex than railguns, and the two are often confused but they are <i>not</i> the same thing at all. Coilguns are a series of magnetic coils, astounding, I know, wrapped in wire to form toroid electromagnets. The magnets are activated when the projectile passes the previous coil, and are deactivated when the projectile reaches them.

            Coilguns have minimal stopping power, compared to the rest and their draw, but have no physical contact with the round, making them much more durable than rail and gauss guns. If you value durability over destruction, coilguns are the weapon for you. If not, read further.
