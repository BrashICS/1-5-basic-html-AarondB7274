            Gauss guns are the most powerful of any on this list, but are also the most self destructive. They have a magnet, electro or permanent, but I recomend electro, a spacer directly between the magnet and bullet and a magnetic driver, which is the actual propeller. The driver is released and the magnet activated, launching the driver towards the magnet. The force of the impact transfers through the spacer to the round, launching it.

            The problem here, is the impact. If you want to launch a slug at 100m/s, the driver has to hit the magnet at <b>100m/s</b>. Do you see the problem here? The drive <i>must</i> hit the magnet with equal velocity to the desired mussle velocity. This makes them most effective in combination with coil and railguns to minimise the damage to the gauss system without limiting the firepower.

            Guass guns are great if you want to take something out in one shot, aslong as you're fine with not getting a second chance.
