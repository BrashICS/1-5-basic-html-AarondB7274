            Railguns are by far the simplest of all magnetic weapons. You can easily make on in your basement with a copper pipe, saw, car battery and an iron bead, it just wont be able to fire twice. Railguns, in their most basic form, consist of two rail and a power source, plus whatever you want to launch. The projectile completes the cirut formed by the rails and power source, forming a megnetic feild behind the projectile, propelling it until it leaves the barrel, cutting the circut.

            Their main problem, aside from the extreme power draw all magnetic weapons are plauged by, is the friction inherent to their design. The <i>sheer</i> amounts of friction between the two rails and the projectile is <i>easily</i> enough to shred both the rails and the projectile into a super heated plasma. In other words, its bad.

            To sumarise, railguns provide ridiculous firepower, but under go equally extreme amounts of strain and power draw. They're good, but not perfect.
