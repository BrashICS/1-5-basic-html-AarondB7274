        <h2>Railguns</h2>

        <p>
            Railguns are by far the simplest of all magnetic weapons. You can easily make on in your basement with a copper pipe, saw, car battery and an iron bead, it just wont be able to fire twice. Railguns, in their most basic form, consist of two rail and a power source, plus whatever you want to launch. The projectile completes the cirut formed by the rails and power source, forming a megnetic feild behind the projectile, propelling it until it leaves the barrel, cutting the circut.
        </p>

        <p>
            Their main problem, aside from the extreme power draw all magnetic weapons are plauged by, is the friction inherent to their design. The <i>sheer</i> amounts of friction between the two rails and the projectile is <i>easily</i> enough to shred both the rails and the projectile into a super heated plasma. In other words, its bad.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To sumarise, railguns provide ridiculous firepower, but under go equally extreme amounts of strain and power draw. They're good, but not perfect.

        <h2>
            Coilguns
        </h2>

        <p>
            Coilguns are more complex than railguns, and the two are often confused but they are <i>not</i> the same thing at all. Coilguns are a series of magnetic coils, astounding, I know, wrapped in wire to form toroid electromagnets. The magnets are activated when the projectile passes the previous coil, and are deactivated when the projectile reaches them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Coilguns have minimal stopping power, compared to the rest and their draw, but have no physical contact with the round, making them much more durable than rail and gauss guns. If you value durability over destruction, coilguns are the weapon for you. If not, read further.

        <h2>
            Gauss Guns
        </h2>

        <p>
            Gauss guns are the most powerful of any on this list, but are also the most self destructive. They have a magnet, electro or permanent, but I recomend electro, a spacer directly between the magnet and bullet and a magnetic driver, which is the actual propeller. The driver is released and the magnet activated, launching the driver towards the magnet. The force of the impact transfers through the spacer to the round, launching it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The problem here, is the impact. If you want to launch a slug at 100m/s, the driver has to hit the magnet at <b>100m/s</b>. Do you see the problem here? The drive <i>must</i> hit the magnet with equal velocity to the desired mussle velocity. This makes them most effective in combination with coil and railguns to minimise the damage to the gauss system without limiting the firepower.
        </p>

        <p>
            Guass guns are great if you want to take something out in one shot, aslong as you're fine with not getting a second chance.

            Summary

        <p>
            So, the choice is yours. If you want durability, coilguns are your best option. But if you're looking for some more kick, you should probably grab a guass gun. But, if you want a well rounded cannon, I recomend the clasic: railguns.
