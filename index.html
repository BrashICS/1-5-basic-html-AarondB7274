            TLDR:
            <br>
            If you want durability, coilguns are your best option. But if you're looking for some more kick, you should probably grab a guass gun. But, if you want a well rounded cannon, I recomend the clasic: railguns. If you really want to ruin someones day, use combo-cannons for maximun power.

            <br>
            As for ammo, solid is good if you want a lot of it, fast, while plasma is good for extreme mag capacities and low friction. Hybrid rounds are great for railguns, and even better in combo-cannons. And then combo rounds are, of course, the best but most complex and expensive.
